tapped-brews
============

A few homebrew recipes for random things that aren't in the main repo

to install mono 3.0 (and fsharp, 3.0.11) do   
`brew install aktowns/tappedbrews/mono3 --use-llvm`

to install qyoto do the following, after installing the above. (if anyone knows how to make depends_on imply --HEAD give me a yell)   
`brew install aktowns/tappedbrews/smokegen --HEAD`  
`brew install aktowns/tappedbrews/smokeqt --HEAD`   
`brew install aktowns/tappedbrews/qyoto --HEAD`
